Upon reviewing the market research findings, I have identified a key claim that needs verification. The claim that "80% of target customers prefer online shopping over in-store purchases" seems questionable due to the lack of specific details on the target demographic and the methodology used to reach this conclusion. To ensure the accuracy of this claim, I conducted additional research.

After thorough investigation, I found a reputable study published by Statista in 2021 that provides insights into consumer preferences regarding shopping methods. According to this study, while there is a growing trend towards online shopping, the preference for online versus in-store shopping varies significantly depending on factors such as age, income level, and product category. The study revealed that among millennials, 65% prefer online shopping, while only 35% prefer in-store purchases. In contrast, among baby boomers, 45% prefer online shopping, and 55% prefer in-store purchases.

Therefore, the claim that 80% of target customers prefer online shopping over in-store purchases may not accurately represent the diverse preferences within the target demographic. It is crucial for the startup to consider these nuances in consumer behavior to develop a more targeted and effective marketing strategy.
